i am currently writing ascii video only player with terminal using c, ncurses and probably ffmpeg.
Is this a good idea ?
My idea was to use ffmpeg to decode the video frames, make average accross time (e.g 10 frames) and space (row 1 and col 1) of the pixels, print the closest terminal color to that corresponding position.
Without giving me the code, because i want to try this my self, can you expand or correct my idea
